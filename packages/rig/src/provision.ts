/**
 * Provision the auxiliary model roles an enabled app set declares.
 *
 * An AgentApp declares the non-`llm` models it needs via `AppFactory.requires`
 * (the static mirror of its `app.json`). The harness boot passes the same
 * factory list it will enable; this reads the aggregate requirement and — for
 * each role some app needs — resolves + loads the model and publishes it on the
 * framework context apps read at construction, BEFORE any factory runs.
 *
 * Today only `reranker` is wired (`RerankerCtx`). The reranker is
 * one-cross-encoder-per-harness, so a single shared instance is loaded IFF some
 * enabled app requires it — a conditional populate of the existing global
 * context, not a per-app service. `embedding` is reserved (no consumer yet).
 *
 * Node-only (`resolveModel` + `createReranker` touch `node:fs` / the native
 * runtime). Import from `@lloyal-labs/rig/node`.
